# Cherry Blossom: Predicting Cherry Blossom
### **Organization: Dr.Bing Zhang Department of Statatics @ the University of Kentucky**
### Authors: Lee Park, Jiyeon Park, Tori Stanton

## **1. Introduction**
In Februray 2022, Tori, Jiyeon, and I created a team to participate the Data Science Competition hosted by the George Mason University.
The goal of the project is to predict when the cherry blossom trees will boom in 2022 and 9 years ahead. 
We collected data from the `rnoaa` packages and found a number of different interaction features using the `rFSA` package.
We had 100 cross validations, not only to find the hyperparameter, but also to compare between the models.
Our final model is the Ridge Regression.


## **2. Organization**
There are several subdirectories to visit to learn more about what we did.
 `Data Preprocessing`: This subdirectory contains how we preprocessed data before fitting the models
 `Prediction`: This just shows how we get the final prediction number. It does not discuss the specification of each model and their performances
 `Data` : You can obtain the clean data in this subdirectory
 `Models`: You can see how we fitted model and tested using cross validation.
