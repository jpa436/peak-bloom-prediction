# Cleaned data sets : cleaned_data.csv

The structure of the cleaned data files is as follows:

* _location_ location identifier (`string`)
* _lat_ (approximate) latitude of the observation (`double`).
* _long_ (approximate) longitude of the observation (`double`).
* _long.x_ cosine of _long_ (`double`).
* _long.y_ sine of _long_ (`double`).
* _alt_ (approximate) altitude of the observation (`double`).
* _year_ year of the observation (`integer`).
* *bloom_date* date of peak bloom of the cherry trees (ISO 8601 date `string`). The "peak bloom date" may be defined differently for different locations.
* *bloom_doy* days since January 1st of the year until peak bloom (`integer`). January 1st is `1`.
* *Date_doy_tavg* doy at which 14 days moving average of `tavg` is at its minimum (`integer`). January 1st is `1` and December 30th and 31st are `-1` and `0` respectively.
* *Date_doy_tmax* doy at which 14 days moving average of `tmax` is at its minimum (`integer`). January 1st is `1` and December 30th and 31st are `-1` and `0` respectively.
* *Date_doy_tmin* doy at which 14 days moving average of `tmin` is at its minimum (`integer`). January 1st is `1` and December 30th and 31st are `-1` and `0` respectively.
* *tavg_below_5* the number of days when the tavg is below 5 Celsius degree between October 1st of the previous year and March 10
* *tavg_above_10* the number of days when the tavg is above 10 Celsius degree between October 1st of the previous year and March 10
* *tavg_moving* the 14 days moving average of tavg at *Date_doy_tavg*
* *tmin_moving* the 14 days moving average of tavg at *Date_doy_tmin*
* *tmax_moving* the 14 days moving average of tavg at *Date_doy_tmax*
* *prcp.n* the number of days when precipitation is above 0 for month n {October: -2, November : -1, December : 0, January : 1, February : 2, March (1st - 10th) : 3}
* *tavg.n* the average `tavg` for month n {October: -2, November : -1, December : 0, January : 1, February : 2, March (1st - 10th) : 3}
* *tmin.n* the average `tmin` for month n {October: -2, November : -1, December : 0, January : 1, February : 2, March (1st - 10th): 3}
* *tmax.n* the average `tmax` for month n {October: -2, November : -1, December : 0, January : 1, February : 2, March (1st - 10th): 3}
